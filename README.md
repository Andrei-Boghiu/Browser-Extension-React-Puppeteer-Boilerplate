# Browser-Extension-React-Puppeteer-Boilerplate

A boilerplate project for creating browser extensions using Puppeteer. Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

## Features

- Provides a template for building browser extensions with Puppeteer.
- Integrates with webpack for bundling JavaScript files.
- Includes TypeScript support for type-checking and improved code quality.
- Uses Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript features for compatibility.
- Includes example scripts for building, linting, and testing the extension.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the extension: `npm run build`

## Usage

To use this boilerplate for your browser extension:

1. Add your Puppeteer scripts in the `src` directory.
2. Customize the webpack configuration in `webpack.config.js` if needed.
3. Modify the `manifest.json` file to specify the details of your extension.
4. Run `npm run build` to bundle your extension code.
5. Load the extension in your browser by following the browser-specific instructions.
